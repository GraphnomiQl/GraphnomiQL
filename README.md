# GraphnomiQL
----
## Motivation
GraphnomiQL is an Interactive Visualizer for GraphQL API

  - Visualize your GraphQL schema
  - Allow editing types and fields *
  - Generate updated schema in SDL 
  - Provide a GraphQL server file to test your schema using GraphiQL
  
**currently GraphnomiQL is not compatible with mutations*  

## Getting Started
- Fork and Clone this Repository
- Open project directory
```sh
cd GraphnomiQL
```
- Install dependencies
```sh
npm install
```
- Open Electron app to run our project
```sh
npm start
```

## How To Use

  - Select one of our demo GraphQL introspection results OR enter your own
   ![modal-screenshot](./src/assets/screenshots/screenshot1.png?raw=true "screenshot1")  
  - Let the magic happen! Put your GraphQL schema in graph!
   ![graph-screenshot](./src/assets/screenshots/screenshot3.png?raw=true "screenshot3")
  - Add a new type or delete an existing type
  - Add a new field to a type (and add a relationship) or delete an existing type
  - Finished updating your schema? Simply click on *Export Schema* or *Export Server* to save the new schema and test it using GraphiQL with provided server.

## Build With

GraphnomiQL uses a number of open source projects to build:

* [React] - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
* [Redux] - A predictable state container for JavaScript apps
* [Electron] - Build cross platform desktop apps with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Express] - fast node.js network app framework
* [Webpack] - an open-source JavaScript module bundler
* [Vis.js] - A dynamic, browser based visualization library
* [React-Graph-Vis] - A react component to render nice graphs using vis.js
* [Material UI] - React components that implement Google's Material Design

And of course GraphnomiQL itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.
